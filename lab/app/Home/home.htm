			<h1>Simon Keefe's Web Development Portfolio</h1>
			<p>My name is Simon Keefe and I am the Front&#8209;End Web Developer at <a href="http://www.rugby.com.au" target="_blank">Australian&nbsp;Rugby&nbsp;Union</a>				in Sydney. I work with a great team to build a wide range of web&#8209;based solutions for local club rugby all the way
				up to our national teams. It is awesome being able to use my skillset in an organisation I am passionate about.</p>
			<p>My primary task involves working on <a href="http://www.rugby.com.au" target="_blank">Rugby.com.au</a> to improve usability
				and ultimately increase traffic. I work closely with the Digital Media Director, assessing potential future enhancements
				and their priority. I am then responsible for the Front-End Development tasks in the sprint, working with a Backend Developer
				until the updates are deployed. I really enjoy my role as it gives me a great opportunity to gain experience making UX
				and IA descions in a high traffic site, whilst also continuing to build my technical skillset.</p>
			<p>In addition, my role involves providing technical support for ARU's other sites, working with various sectors of the organisation
				to build and refine our digital presence.</p>
			<p>Prior to my current role I was the Senior Front-End Developer at Cornerstone Digital. I really enjoyed my time here working
				with the team to create high quality web solutions for our clients.</p>
			<p>Offline my wife and I are quickly learning how much energy is required to look after two children under two! It is exciting,
				and at times, taxing! We live in Sydney, spend a lot of time with friends and family and are involved in our <a href="http://www.stjohnsasquith.org.au/"
